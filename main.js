//  * Hello challenger! Your task is to complete a function named `passwordStrength` 
//  * which takes in a password (a string) and you return back a number of how strong that
//  * password is!
//  * 
//  * Your implementation should handle password strings for the following levels:
//  *
//  * Password Strength Level 1: Very Weak
//  * Requirements: Any combination of characters.
//  * Example: "password"
//  * Explanation: This is the weakest type of password as it's commonly used and easily guessed.
//  *
//  * Password Strength Level 2: Weak
//  * Requirements: At least one number.
//  * Example: "password123"
//  * Explanation: Adding a number increases the password's complexity slightly but is still relatively easy to guess, especially if the number is predictable (e.g., birth year).
//  * 
//  * Password Strength Level 3: Medium
//  * Requirements: At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
//  * Example: "Password123"
//  * Explanation: This level of complexity improves security but is still susceptible to dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks, especially if the password is short.
//  * 
//  * Password Strength Level 4: Strong
//  * Requirements: At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
//  * Example: "Password123!"
//  * Explanation: Incorporating a special character significantly enhances password strength, making it harder to crack.
//  * 
//  * Password Strength Level 5: Very Strong
//  * Requirements: At least 12 characters, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
//  * Example: "!P@ssw0rd12!"
//  * Explanation: A long, complex password with random characters is the most secure option.
//  *
//  * 
//  * Good luck!
