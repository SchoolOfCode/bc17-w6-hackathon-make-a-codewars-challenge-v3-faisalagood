# ðŸ’ª **Password Strength Kata** ðŸ’ª

### Objective:

This kata challenges you to create a function that **evaluates the strength of a given password** \
and returns a **corresponding integer value**. The higher the value, the stronger the password! ðŸ’ª

## Password Strength Levels ðŸ’ª:

- **Level 1**: Very Weak (any combination of characters)
- **Level 2**: Weak (at least one number)
- **Level 3**: Medium (at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number)
- **Level 4**: Strong (at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special character)
- **Level 5**: Very Strong (at least 12 characters, a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)

## Function âŒ¨:

Fill in the function named **passwordStrength** that takes a password string as input.
The function should **return an integer** representing the password's **strength level** (1-5).

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡:

This kata was inspired by a **Coderbyte password function test**. While the original test focused on determining if a password met a single strong password criteria, this kata expands on the concept by introducing different strength levels for more granular evaluation.

~ Have fun and happy coding!
